# Recap

 - Do geographical location and characteristics have an effect on internet quality of life in the UK? 
 - Feb / Aug 2019 - data.gov.uk - Ofcom
 - GDHI data per region - ONS

---

# Findings

 - We saw trends in the data that exist between location and Internet QOL
 - Not enough data to be able to back up this link
 - Unable to establish a clear/strong connection given the data we had

# Model Training and Prediction

 - Some predicted values were similar to the observed

 - However many were significantly different.

 - ADS = 39.15 + Urban/Rural(42.26) + GDHI(1.67*10^-4)

 - Equation of model heavily weighted to significance of urban/rural.

 - This suggests some other variable may be involved or more data is required to see significance of GDHI
