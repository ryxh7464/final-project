## Research Question

Our research question is the following: "Do geographical location and characteristics have an effect on internet quality of life in the UK?". 

Internet quality of life is becoming more important than ever - especially with how increasingly online our world is becoming. We aim to examine the relationships between geographical location of UK internet users (and related metrics such as household income) and metrics which can help us gain a picture of internet quality of life, such as download speed. We will also consider how things have changed over the course of two months at different points in the year.

## Data

For our project we used 3 datasets in total, 2 from data.gov.ukm, and one from ons.gov.uk. The first two datasets concern fixed line broadband speeds in the UK in February and August 2019, respectively. Both datasets come from Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator. The broadband data was collected from a sample of customers who had speed monitoring equipment stored in their homes.

The third dataset contains information on the GDHI (Gross Disposable Household Income) for UK consituent countries and regions.

For the purposes of our project, we will be mainly focusing on 24 hour average download speed, Urban/Rural (whether or not a reading comes from an urban or rural location) and GDHI per head.

### Initial data visualisation using choropleth maps

To explore regional variations and see if there were any obvious trends or correlations, we initially created choropleth maps of the average 24 hour download speed in February and August, the GDHI, and the ratio between average download speed in urban and rural areas, for each region. These maps could then be compared to each other, to see if speeds had changed over time and if there were similarities in the spatial trends of different variables, and then these relationships could be investigated further in the models.

```{r maps, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

region_map <- geojson_read("uk_regions.geojson", what = "sp") %>%
  rename(region = rgn19nm)

feb_avg <- feb_2019 %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(mean_24hr = mean(x24_hr_average_download_speed))

feb_joined <- region_map %>%
  geo_join(feb_avg, by = "region", how = "left")

aug_avg <- aug_2019 %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(mean_24hr = mean(x24_hr_average_download_speed))

aug_joined <- region_map %>%
  geo_join(aug_avg, by = "region", how = "left")

reds <- brewer.pal(9, "Reds")
blues <- brewer.pal(9, "Blues")
greens <- brewer.pal(9, "Greens")

class_feb <- cut(feb_joined$mean_24hr, 9)
col_feb <- reds[as.numeric(class_feb)]

class_aug <- cut(aug_joined$mean_24hr, 9)
col_aug <- reds[as.numeric(class_aug)]

gdhi_joined <- region_map %>%
  geo_join(gdhi_region, by = "region", how = "left")

class_gdhi <- cut(gdhi_joined$gdhi_per_head, 9)
col_gdhi <- blues[as.numeric(class_gdhi)]

disparity <- feb_2019 %>%
  group_by(region, urban_rural) %>%
  summarise(avg_24hr = mean(x24_hr_average_download_speed)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = urban_rural, values_from = avg_24hr) %>%
  mutate(ratio = Urban/Rural)
  
disparity$ratio <- replace_na(disparity$ratio, 1)

disparity_joined <- region_map %>%
  geo_join(disparity, by = "region", how = "left")

class_disp <- cut(disparity_joined$ratio, 9)
col_disp <- greens[as.numeric(class_disp)]
```

```{r speed-maps,  fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

plot(feb_joined, col = col_feb, main = "UK 24 hour average broadband speed by region, February 2019",
     sub = "Data from data.gov.uk")

plot(aug_joined, col = col_aug, main = "UK 24 hour average broadband speed by region, August 2019",
     sub = "Data from data.gov.uk")
```
These two maps both suggest a similar trend in average speeds - they seem to be higher on average in the south, but the highest speed is found in Yorkshire and Humberside in both despite low speeds in surrounding regions, and the lowest is in Wales. This pattern does not change significantly from February to August, although some speeds appear to become slightly higher. 

```{r gdhi-map,  fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

plot(gdhi_joined, col = col_gdhi, main = "Gross disposable household income per region in the UK, 2019", 
     sub = "Data from ons.gov.uk")
```
Comparing the GDHI map to the average download speed maps, we see that, while both have areas of higher values in the south, regions such as Yorkshire and Northern Ireland have high average speeds despite their comparatively low GDHI, suggesting that this relationship is more complex and there may be other variables involved.

```{r ratio-map,  fig.height = 5, fig.width = 10, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

plot(disparity_joined, col = col_disp, main = "Ratio of urban to rural download speeds in the UK, February 2019", 
     sub = "Data from data.gov.uk")
```
This map suggests that the highest urban/rural disparities tend to be in areas with lower download speeds - the lowest being in Scotland and the highest in London - which could suggest that whether an area is urban or rural has an impact on internet quality. This could also imply a connection to population density, with the highest disparities being in areas of low population density, however this is beyond the scope of this project.

### The impact of GDHI and urban/rural location on internet quality
To examine relationships between different variables in our dataset (variables which relate to location and internet quality of life, or IQOL) we experimented with fitting various linear models to our data. We started by looking primarily at investigating the link between the variables household income (GDHI per head, where GDHI stands for Gross Domestic Household Income), and Urban/Rural (whether a broadband customer lived in an urban or rural location), and internet quality of life indicators. We focused first on 24 hour average download speed, but then moved on to look at other variables such as packet loss and Netflix start up delay. Packet loss is when is when data packets sent over the internet fail to reach their destination (1), and this manifests itself in network disruption and slow service, which we felt were key when determining internet quality. We also focused on Netflix startup delay - given the rising popularity of internet streaming services, and the fact that Netflix is the most popular in the UK (2). A household with good internet quality of life would have high download speeds, lower packet loss, minimal startup delays, etc.

We plotted the following linear regression models using GDHI as a single predictor for 24 hour download speed, packet loss and Netflix start up delay:

```{r income-24h_download, echo = FALSE}
# Predicting 24 hour average download speed from GDHI per head
all_24h_ads_gdhi_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hr_average_download_speed ~ gdhi_per_head, data = all_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
all_24h_ads_gdhi_fit
```

```{r income-24h_packetloss, echo = FALSE}
# Predicting 24 hour packet loss from GDHI per head
all_24h_pl_gdhi_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hour_packet_loss ~ gdhi_per_head, data = all_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
all_24h_pl_gdhi_fit
```

```{r income-24h_netflixstartupdelay, echo = FALSE}
# Predicting 24 hour netflix startup delay from GDHI per head
all_24h_nsud_gdhi_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hour_netflix_start_up_delay ~ gdhi_per_head, data = all_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
all_24h_nsud_gdhi_fit
```

Here we see that increased GDHI is linked to increased IQOL, with the model estimating that households with higher GDHI per head will have higher download speeds, less packet loss and lower Netflix start up delays. Note that the coefficients are comparatively small - in context, an average household in Yorkshire & Humber would have an estimated 24 hour download speed of approximately 65.3Mbps, compared to a household in London which we could estimate a speed of 81.3Mbps for (they have GDHI per head values of £17959 and £30256 respectively according to the dataset).

Next we looked at predicting 24 hour download speed from Urban/Rural:
```{r urbanrural-24h_download, echo = FALSE}
all_24h_ads_ur_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hr_average_download_speed ~ urban_rural, data = all_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
all_24h_ads_ur_fit
```
We can compare this to see how this has changed from February to August:
```{r urbanrural-24h_download-feb, echo = FALSE}
feb_24h_ads_ur_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hr_average_download_speed ~ urban_rural, data = feb_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
feb_24h_ads_ur_fit
```
```{r urbanrural-24h_download-aug, echo = FALSE}
aug_24h_ads_ur_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hr_average_download_speed ~ urban_rural, data = aug_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
aug_24h_ads_ur_fit
```

Here we see that on average, households in rural locations are worse off in terms of broadband speed - with urban locations having speeds around twice as fast as rural households (not taking into account region or income, etc.).

We can also try predicting packet loss and Netflix start up delay from the Urban/Rural variable as well for both years combined - results are below.
```{r ur-24h_packetloss, echo = FALSE}
# Predicting 24 hour packet loss from GDHI per head
all_24h_pl_gdhi_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hour_packet_loss ~ urban_rural, data = all_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
all_24h_pl_gdhi_fit
```

```{r ur-24h_netflixstartupdelay, echo = FALSE}
# Predicting 24 hour netflix startup delay from GDHI per head
all_24h_nsud_gdhi_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(x24_hour_netflix_start_up_delay ~ urban_rural, data = all_gdhi_join) %>%
  tidy()
all_24h_nsud_gdhi_fit
```
This data supports the idea that Urban households have better internet quality of life - we see lower packet loss and lower startup delays on average for Urban households (again, not taking into account location / GDHI, etc.)

Finally we decided to see if we could predict 24 hour download speed based off of the variables of GDHI per head and Urban/Rural. The data was split with 75% of observations in the training set, and 25% in the testing set. We can see a snapshot of the results of the model below, compared to the actual values:

```{r setseed-split, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
all_gdhi_join_split <- initial_split(all_gdhi_join)
all_gdhi_join_train <- training(all_gdhi_join_split)
all_gdhi_join_test <- testing(all_gdhi_join_split)
```
```{r variables effect 24h-download, echo=FALSE }
all_gdhi_join_train_rec <- recipe(x24_hr_average_download_speed ~ urban_rural + gdhi_per_head, data = all_gdhi_join_train) %>%
 step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) 

all_gdhi_join_train_mod <- linear_reg() %>%
 set_engine('lm')

all_gdhi_join_train_wflow <- workflow() %>% 
 add_model(all_gdhi_join_train_mod) %>% 
 add_recipe(all_gdhi_join_train_rec)

all_gdhi_join_train_fit <- all_gdhi_join_train_wflow %>% 
 fit(data = all_gdhi_join_train)

all_gdhi_join_train_fit
```
```{r predictions_1, echo=FALSE}
all_2019_24h_ads_predict <- predict(all_gdhi_join_train_fit, new_data = all_gdhi_join_test) %>%
  bind_cols(all_gdhi_join_test %>% select(x24_hr_average_download_speed, urban_rural, gdhi_per_head))
all_2019_24h_ads_predict 
```

We can also see the adjusted R squared value for the model below:
```{r modelrsquared, echo=FALSE}
glance(all_gdhi_join_train_fit)$adj.r.squared
```
Here we get a value of 7.5%, which is quite low, suggesting that the model is not very good at predicting average download speed, as it does a poor job of predicting the test set data.

### The impact of distance from exchange on internet quality
As part of geographic location, distance from exchange is also an important factor affecting internet quality. We have used linear regression to analyze the extent to which average download speed, jitter, latency and packet loss are affected by distance from exchange.

These parameters are valuable to study as they affect many aspects of network life, such as latency affecting the gaming experience, average download speed and packet loss affecting load time, and jitter affecting call quality. 

The following are linear regression models for the various parameters and distance from exchange in February and August, respectively.

```{r (feb)average_download_speed VS distance_from_exchange, echo=FALSE}

Based on these linear regressions, it can be concluded that average download speed and distance from exchange are negatively correlated, and latency and packet loss are positively correlated with distance from exchange. In February, for every 1000m increase in distance from exchange, the average download speed will decrease by 6.3Mbps, the latency will increase by 1.1ms and the packet loss rate will increase by 0.014%, on average. In August, for every 1000m increase in distance from exchange, the average download speed will decrease by 4.6Mbps, the latency will increase by 0.38ms and the packet loss rate will increase by 0.005%, on average.

However, according to the following code, jitter doesn’t correlate to distance from exchange.


```{r (feb) jitter upstream VS distance_from_exchange, echo=FALSE}
feb_2019_ju_dfe <- feb_2019_dfe %>%
  select(distance_from_exchange, x24_hour_jitter_upstream) %>%
  group_by(distance_from_exchange) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_ju = mean(x24_hour_jitter_upstream)
  )

feb_2019_ju_dfe_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_ju ~ distance_from_exchange, data = feb_2019_ju_dfe) %>%
  tidy()
feb_2019_ju_dfe_fit
```


```{r (aug) jitter upstream VS distance_from_exchange, echo=FALSE}
aug_2019_ju_dfe <- aug_2019_dfe %>%
  select(distance_from_exchange, x24_hour_jitter_upstream) %>%
  group_by(distance_from_exchange) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_ju = mean(x24_hour_jitter_upstream)
  )

  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_ju ~ distance_from_exchange, data = aug_2019_ju_dfe) %>%
  tidy()
aug_2019_ju_dfe_fit
```


```{r (feb) jitter downstream VS distance_from_exchange, echo=FALSE}
feb_2019_jd_dfe <- feb_2019_dfe %>%
  select(distance_from_exchange, x24_hour_jitter_downstream) %>%
  group_by(distance_from_exchange) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_jd = mean(x24_hour_jitter_downstream)
  )

feb_2019_jd_dfe_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_jd ~ distance_from_exchange, data = feb_2019_jd_dfe) %>%
  tidy()

```


```{r (aug) jitter downstream VS distance_from_exchange, echo=FALSE}
aug_2019_jd_dfe <- aug_2019_dfe %>%

  group_by(distance_from_exchange) %>%

    avg_jd = mean(x24_hour_jitter_downstream)
  )

  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(avg_jd ~ distance_from_exchange, data = aug_2019_jd_dfe) %>%

aug_2019_jd_dfe_fit
```

Since jitter upstream is slightly negatively and positively correlated with distance from exchange in February and August respectively, it can be concluded that jitter is not directly related to distance from exchange. Hence, distance from exchange doesn’t affect call quality, which is affected by jitter.

A number of residual plots were used to check the accuracy of the linear regression. All residual plots have points evenly distributed around zero, indicating that it is appropriate to use linear regression to analyze the relationships between these variables and distance from exchange.

According to the following code, in 2019, the average download speed, latency and packet loss all greatly affect the page load time. Every 1Mbps increase in download speed decreases load time by 0.0017 seconds, every 1ms increase in latency increases load time by 0.037 seconds, and every 1% increase in packet loss increases load time by 0.29 seconds, on average. And these three parameters are all influenced by distance from exchange. Therefore it can be further concluded that distance from exchange indirectly affects the internet quality of life, such as the page load time.

We assume that internet quality can be defined by average download speed, packet loss and latency on the internet in 24 hours. 
And they are influenced by geolocations that whether users are at urban or rural as well as their regions located in the UK and distance from the exchange.
We can see from the graphs that in rural areas, users generally experiened lower download speed, higher packet loss and higher latency. 
Also, for distance from exchange, since the categories of the variable is too long to be used and would cause disordered y-axis, I redefine them as a new simple category.

### Limitations of project
One of the key limitations of our data was the fact that GDHI was given to us only by region. This made it difficult to compare households in the same areas which had different incomes - i.e. high income rural households vs low income rural households. As a result we were not able to see whether different incomes in areas affected the broadband speed that customers could obtain.

Additionally, it was difficult to add keys to the choropleth maps as base R was used for the plotting. With more time it would be useful to have a key on the maps. However, the key is not essential in this situation because the maps were only used to visually compare trends and not to determine specific values.
